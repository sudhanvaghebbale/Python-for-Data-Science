# Python-for-Data-Science
This repository contains a basic tutorial of Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly. Each notebook has code that gets you started for each topic. 

## Numpy
  * To get started with numpy, you need to install the numpy package using the pip installer. 
    ```
    pip install numpy
    ```
  * NumPy is the one of the most used package for scientific computing. Various functions that could be performed using the numpy package:
    * Broacasting functions using N-dimensional arrays
    * Linear algebra
    * Fourier transform
    * Statistics based computation
  
  * To get a detailed insight into Numpy, check out this tutorial: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html.
    
## Pandas
  * To get started with pandas, you need to install the pandas package using the pip installer. 
    ```
    pip install pandas
    ```
  * Pandas is one of the most commonly used packages to work with CSV files. Various functions that could be performed using the pandas package:
    * Statistics based computation
    * Cleaning data in files
    * Visualize data 

  * To get a detailed insight into Pandas, check out this tutorial: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html
  
## Matplotlib
  * To get started with matplotlib, you need to install the matplotlib package using the pip installer. 
    ```
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
  * Matplotlib is one of the most commonly used packages to visualize data. Various functions that could be performed using the matplotlib package:
    * Scatter Plots, Histograms
    * Bar Plots, Area Plots

## Seaborn
  * To get started with Seaborn, you need to install the seaborn package using the pip installer. 
    ```
    pip install seaborn
    ```
  * Seaborn is one of the most commonly used packages to perform advanced visualization. Various functions that could be performed using the seaborn package:
    * Heat Maps
    * Violin Plots
    * Swarm Plots
    * Box Plots

  * To get a detailed insight into seaborn, check out this tutorial: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html  
  
## Plotly
  * To get started with Plotly, you need to install the plotly package using the pip installer. 
    ```
    pip install plotly
    ```
  * Plotly is one of the most commonly used packages to perform interactive visualizations. Various functions that could be performed using the plotly package:
    * Area Plots
    * Scatter Plots
    * Word Count

  * To get a detailed insight into plotly, check out this tutorial: https://plotly.com/python/plotly-fundamentals
  * The plotly file does not show the interactive graphs to GitHub. Therefore, have a look at this following link: https://www.kaggle.com/kanncaa1/plotly-tutorial-for-beginners
